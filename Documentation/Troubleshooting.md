## Projects didn't Build or Generate Correctly

If you want a complete generation, ensure that the menu `MSBuild > Full Generation Enabled` is checked, if you don't know then most likely you don't need it. Also, you could trigger the regeneration step manually, by invoking `MSBuild > Regenerate C# SDK Projects`.
